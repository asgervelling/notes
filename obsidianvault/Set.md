An unordered collection of unique elements such as 
$A = \{1, 2, 3, 5\}$ or $B = \{a, b, c\}$.

##### Set-builder notation
Set-builder notation is a useful notation for creating a set from a condition on its elements:
$$
S = \{x | x < \mathbb{N}\ \land x < 5\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
$$
You could use it to describe the set of all rational numbers:
$$
Q = \{\frac{a}{b} | a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0 \}
$$
