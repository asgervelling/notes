In [[Cryptography]], a block cipher is an algorithm that encrypts a plaintext of fixed length, called a block.
A block cipher is used in a [[Block Cipher Mode of Operation|mode of operation]], to produce a ciphertext that provides data confidentiality and authenticity.
A block cipher needs a mode of operation, because it only encrypts a block at a time.
