An [[IT-Security Principle]].

Making things hard to understand or find, in order for the adversary to have a difficult time understanding or finding them.

### Example
Some people place an extra key to their house under one particular stone in the front yard in case they forget or lose their main key.

*Caveat:* In practice, burglars know where to look for the extra key. Nonetheless, the location of the key has been obscured, at least more than if it was simply placed on a shelf next to the front door.

You could argue that if the people know that this is insecure, they are prioritizing convenience over security.
After all, we only have to be more secure than the less secure target. The adversary will go for the weakest target.
