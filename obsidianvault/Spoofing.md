In the context of information security, and especially network security, a spoofing attack is a situation in which a person or program successfully identifies as another by falsifying data, to gain an illegitimate advantage. [^1]

### IP Spoofing
- If an adversary decides to hide his IP address, it can be useful to him when sending disruptive packets, such as in a [[Denial-Of-Service attack|DoS attack]].
- It is not useful to the adversary, when using a persistent [[Internet Connection|connection]]. Because the victim server will simply send its packets to the fake IP address, so not even a [[Three-Way Handshake|handshake]] is possible.
