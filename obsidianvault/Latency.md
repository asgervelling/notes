How quickly can we get a response?
For example: How long does it take to read just a single byte from the disk? Or, how long does it take from the user clicks a button, to the program responds to that click?

If $T_1, T_2$ are the runtimes of programs $P_1, P_2$, then the speedup in latency of $P_2$ over $P_1$ is $$\frac{T_1}{T_2}$$

If a program is concurrent, its max theoretical speedup is given by [[Amdahl's Law]].
