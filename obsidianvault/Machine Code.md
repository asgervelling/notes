## Definition
A machine-readable sequence of instructions that cause the computer to change its state.

- A primitive programming language directly implemented by hardware.
- We use a textual surface called assembly code.
- An assembler turns human-readable assembly code into actual machine code.

## Types of Machine Code

- Early machine code languages were intended for human programming and had many conveniences and even high-level features.
- Each architecture has its own machine code; new machines often had new ones with more features.
- Today the vast majority of programmers use [[Compiler|compilers]] to generate machine code.
- Fairly few general-purpose architectures in use, most quite similar:
  - x86: Intel and AMD processors, used in most PCs and servers.
  - ARM: Previously mostly for low-power and mobile, now also used in Apple's newer laptops and encroaching on servers.
  - POWER: IBM's architecture, still in use for some high-end servers.
  - [[RISC-V]]: Open architecture, very new, currently mostly used for embedded purposes, but growing.
  - Long tail: MIPS, SPARC, Alpha, z/Architecture, GPUs, DSPs, ...
