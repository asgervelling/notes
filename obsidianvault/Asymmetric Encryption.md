Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, utilizes a pair of keys for secure communication: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The keys are mathematically linked but computationally infeasible to derive one from the other. This approach enables secure data transmission, digital signatures, and authentication. Common algorithms include RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

### Key Features

- **Key Pairs:** Asymmetric encryption involves a public key and a private key, ensuring secure communication between entities.
- **Security Strength:** The security relies on complex mathematical relationships between the keys, making it highly secure.

### Use Cases

- **Secure Communication:** Used in HTTPS for secure web browsing, secure email communication, and file transmission.
- **Digital Signatures:** Provides authenticity and integrity in digital documents and transactions.
