In law, non-repudiation is a situation where a statement's author cannot successfully dispute its authorship or the validity of an associated contract. The term is often seen in a legal setting when the authenticity of a signature is being challenged. In such an instance, the authenticity is being "repudiated". [^1]

In [[IT-Security]], it means the attacker cannot say "it wasn't me".

A [[Digital Signature]] will often be used to guarantee non-repudiation.
