> **Digital subscriber line** (**DSL**; originally **digital subscriber loop**) is a family of technologies that are used to transmit digital data over telephone lines.

Digital Subscriber Line (DSL, originally Digital Subscriber Loop) is a family of [[Internet Access Technologies|access technologies]] used to transmit data over telephone lines.

When you buy DSL internet access from your ISP, you get a modem. It connects to a phone line.
A residence typically obtains DSL internet access from the same local telephone company that provides wired local phone access. Thus, the phone company is also the home's [[ISP]].
In your home, you probably have a DSL [[Modem]]. 

The DSL modem takes digital data and transforms it to high-frequency tones for transmission over phone wires to the central office.

DSL has three
- A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
- A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
- An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band

This makes the single DSL link appear as if there were three separate links, so a phone call and an internet connection can share a DSL link at the same time.

##### Types of DSL
- Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)
	- Download speed is considerably faster than upload speed
	- Typically used in homes
	- The cheapest form of DSL
- Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL)
	- Download speed and upload speed is the same
	- Typically used in businesses
- Very high bit rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL)
	- Fast form of DSL
	- Uses copper wire, making it best suited for short distances
	- For long distances, it can use fiber optic cable.
	- ~3 times faster than ADSL
##### Downsides
DSL is not as fast as [[Broadband Cable|cable]].

##### Upsides
DSL is cheaper than cable.
You don't have to share [[Bandwidth]] with your neighborhood like with cable. Everyone using DSL has their own dedicated connection.
