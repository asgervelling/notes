Symmetric encryption involves a single key for both encryption and decryption of data. This key must be securely shared between the communicating parties. Common symmetric encryption algorithms include [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]], DES (Data Encryption Standard), and 3DES (Triple DES).

### Key Features

- **Single Key:** Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, simplifying the process.
- **Efficiency:** Symmetric encryption is generally faster and less computationally intensive than asymmetric encryption.

### Use Cases

- **Data Encryption:** Utilized for securing stored data, file encryption, and communication within closed systems.
- **Performance-Centric Applications:** Suitable for applications where speed and efficiency are critical, such as network communication within secure environments.
