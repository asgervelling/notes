Cable internet is a high speed [[Internet Access Technologies|access technology]] that uses a cable modem which provides a link to the [[ISP]].
Broadband cable is typically provided by the same provider that provides cabled television to their customers. 

When you buy cable internet, your cable ISP sends you a [[Modem]]. Typically, they actually send you a modem / [[WiFi]] [[Router]] combo - often referred to as a gateway. This combo has a built in modem, [[switch]] and WiFi router.
The modem brings internet into your home. The switch and the WiFi router make sure you can connect your end systems, like PCs and phones, to the modem to give them [[Internet Access Technologies|internet access]].


##### Downside of Cable
Your whole neighborhood will have to share the same cable (share the same [[bandwidth]]).
