We need a language to talk about logic with.

### Declarative Sentences
A declarative sentence is one that you can argue as being true or false. Such as

- The sum of the numbers 3 and 5 equals 8.
- Jane reacted violently to Jack's accusations.
- All Martians love pepperoni on their pizza.

The third sentence is [[Goldbach's Conjecture]], and has to this day not been proved or disproved.


**Valid Argument**
- An argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, the argument has a valid form or structure that ensures that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.
- Validity is about the relationship between the premises and the conclusion, not necessarily the truth of the premises or conclusion.

**Sound Argument**  
- An argument is sound if it is valid, and all of its premises are true. In other words, a sound argument not only has a logically valid structure but also starts with true premises, ensuring a true conclusion.
- Soundness combines both logical validity and the truth of the premises, making it a stronger condition than validity alone.
