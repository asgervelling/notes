Part of [[Reactive and Event Based Systems (REBS)]].

## Process
A series of steps or actions taken to achieve a particular end. Examples include
- The production of a car
- Filing an insurance claim
- Algorithms

#### How do we model processes?
We need a well-defined language for our models: **Formal Methods**.

Formal methods offer

- Unambiguous semantics
- Model checking
- Conformance checking
- Run-time Verification
- Simulation
- Execution
 - Automated (fx assembly lines)
 - User guidance (fx call centers)

### Imperative vs Declarative Process Modelling

**Imperative notations**
- Used for structured processes
- Describe flow
- Nothing allowed by default
- Describe desired behavior

**Declarative notations**
- Used for flexible processes
- Describe constraints
- Everything allowed by default
- Describe forbidden behavior

*A more flexible declarative process, where everyone is an expert and many things may happen at once and in flexible order.*
