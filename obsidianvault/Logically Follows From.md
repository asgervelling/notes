To say that something logically follows from something will be defined more rigorously later. For now, consider these sentences:

> If the train arrives late and there are no taxis at the station, then John is late for his meeting. John is not late for his meeting. The train did arrive late. *Therefore*, there were taxis at the station.

All these sentences state something about John's situation. The part after the word "therefore" *logically follows* from the sentences before it.
Consider another example:

> If it is raining and Jane does not have her umbrella with her, then she will get wet. Jane is not wet. It is raining. *Therefore*, Jane has her umbrella with her.


Both these examples share the same pattern. Let's break it up into parts

|Example 1|Example 2|
|-|-|
|the train is late|it is raining|
|there are taxis at the station|Jane has her umbrella with her|
|John is late for his meeting.|Jane gets wet.|


The argument in each example can be stated as

If $p$ and not $q$, then $r$. Not $r$. $p$. **Therefore**, $q$.

Try constructing it in your head.
